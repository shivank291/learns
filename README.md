#### a description.

this repository is for storing my learnings of .cpp and some competitive programming stuff.
in future i might make the repository public. who knows.

> each directory has a notes.md ( or maybe it has multiple ) which covers the notes of learnings of .cpp, data structures and algorithms, competitive programming. welp, that's that.
